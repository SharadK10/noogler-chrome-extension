# noogler-chrome-extension
Let's become a Noogler - the chrome extension that randomly opens up a leetcode question tagged with google

# How this works
For this extension to work do the following steps
1. Clone this repo
2. Put a csv called holy-grail.csv in /public containing Leetcode questions in the format - {Quesion Id}. {Title} {Acceptance rate}% {Difficulty} (Honestly you can find these kind of csv for all FAANG companies all over github).
3. Go to chrome's manage extension section and enable developer mode
4. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select you repo folder from local
5. There you have it your own chrome extension, open it and click on search, it will open a random question from csv everytime.

Cheers!
